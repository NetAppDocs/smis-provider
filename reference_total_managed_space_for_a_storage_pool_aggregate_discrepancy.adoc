= Total managed space for a storage pool (volume) discrepancy
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ./media/

* *Issue*
+
If you are using another storage management tool, such as FilerView, you might notice a different size reported for the total managed space for a storage pool (volume) than the size returned by SMI-S Provider.

* *Cause*
+
This discrepancy occurs because the size returned by SMI-S Provider includes the WAFL and Snapshot reserve, while FilerView and other tools show only the usable space, excluding WAFL and Snapshot reserve.

* *Corrective action*
+
This is an expected behavior; no corrective action.
