You must have a FlexClone license for SMI-S Provider to create LUN clones.

SMI-S Provider creates LUN clones on that storage system using only FlexClone technology. If you do not have a FlexClone license, SMI-S Provider does not generate clones using LUN clone technology, and it generates the following error message:

`FlexClone license is not enabled on the storage system.`

If you have LUN clones that were created using LUN clone technology, and the Data ONTAP version is then upgraded to 7.3.1 or later, you cannot use SMI-S Provider to split those clones. They must be managed by the storage system administrator.
