By default, SSL authentication is enabled for the CIM server. During the SMI-S Provider installation, a self-signed certificate for the CIM server is installed in the `pegasus` directory. You can generate your own self-signed certificate and use it rather than the default certificate.

.Before you begin

* You must already have logged in as Administrator.
* You must already have accessed SMI-S Provider.

.Steps

. Download the `openssl.cnf` file from the following location: link:http://web.mit.edu/crypto/openssl.cnf[http://web.mit.edu/crypto/openssl.cnf^] 
. Move the `openssl.cnf` file to the bin directory:
+
`*%PEGASUS_HOME%\bin\openssl.cnf*`
. Set the `OPENSSL_CONF` environmental variable to the location of the `openssl.cnf` file:
+
`*C:\ >set OPENSSL_CONF=%PEGASUS_HOME%\bin\openssl.cnf*`
+
This only sets the variable for the duration of the current CLI session. To set the variable permanently, you can use one of the following options:
+ 
* Option 1: Right click  *Properties > Environmental Variables* and set the variable under *System*.
* Option 2: Use the CLI to permanently set the variable:
+
`*setx OPENSSL_CONF â€œ%PEGASUS_HOME%\bin\openssl.cnf*`. 
+
The variable is available when you open a new CLI session.

. Navigate to the `%PEGASUS_HOME%\bin` directory:
+
`*C:\cd %pegasus_home%\bin*`
. Generate a private key:
+
`*openssl genrsa -out cimom.key 2048*`
. Generate a certificate request:
+
`*openssl req -new -key cimom.key -out cimom.csr*`

. Enter your information for the certificate request when prompted.
. Generate the self-signed certificate:
+
`*openssl x509 -in cimom.csr -out cimom.cert -req -signkey cimom.key -days 1095*`
+
You can provide a different number of days for which the certificate is valid.

. Copy the `cimom.key` and `cimom.cert` files to the `pegasus` directory (Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\NetApp\smis\pegasus`).

== Result

The certificate date range starts at the current date and runs for the number of days specified.
