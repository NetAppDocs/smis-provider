* *Issue*
+
If you are using a firewall other than the default Windows firewall, you might experience the following issues:

 ** SMI-S Provider is unable to communicate with a removed SMI-S client.
 ** The SMI-S client is unable to receive indications from SMI-S Provider.

* *Cause*
+
This issue occurs when you use a firewall other than the default Windows firewall without first manually adding the necessary ports as exceptions.

* *Corrective action*
+
Add ports 427, 5988, and 5989 as exceptions to your firewall.
