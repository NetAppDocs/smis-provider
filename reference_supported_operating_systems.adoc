== SCVMM 2016 UR 2.1 requirement

System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) 2016 Update Rollup (UR) 2.1 is required to manage NetApp File Server with NetApp SMI-S Provider 5.2.4 and later.

* The provider host machine cannot be used to host a Hyper-V node.
* SCVMM must not be running on the provider host machine.
* The provider host machine must not run other programs that are memory-intensive.
* The provider host machine must not run SMI-S providers from any other vendor.

The following hypervisors are supported:

* VMware ESX 5.0
* VMware ESX 5.1
