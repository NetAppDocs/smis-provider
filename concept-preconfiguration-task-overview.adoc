Before using SMI-S Provider for the first time, you must validate your preliminary configuration.

Perform the following tasks before using SMI-S Provider:

. From NetApp SMI-S Provider, verify that the CIM server is started.
. Add a CIM server user.
. Verify management of the storage system by adding at least one storage system for SMI-S Provider.
. *Optional:* Generate a self-signed certificate for the CIMOM.

By default, authentication is enabled for SMI-S Provider.

After you have successfully performed this validation, you can begin to manage your storage systems using NetApp SMI-S Provider.
