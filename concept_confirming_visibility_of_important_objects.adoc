After adding a managed storage system, you should confirm that you can see all the important logical and physical objects in NetApp SMI-S Provider.

You can use the `smis` command to see the objects that are in the NetApp SMI-S Provider CIMOM repository. For example, use `smis list` to display added storage systems, and use `smis luns` to display LUN information.
