NetApp SMI-S Provider uses CIM-XML encoding over HTTPS and Service Location Protocol (SLP).

* *CIM-XML encoding over HTTPS*
+
Protocol that exchanges information between a Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM)-enabled management client and the CIMOM server. CIM-XML encoding over HTTPS uses the CIM protocol as the payload and HTTPS as the transport. HTTP is also supported.

* *SLP*
+
Discovery protocol that detects WBEM services within a LAN.
