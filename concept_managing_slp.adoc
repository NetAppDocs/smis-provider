The SLP service broadcasts WBEM services. When the SLP service is enabled, client applications can discover the CIMOM server. You can also specify SLP configuration settings using the `slp.conf` file.

If the SLP service is not already enabled, you can start the SLP service by using the `smis slpd start` command. To stop the SLP service, use the `smis slpd stop` command.
