= SMB share size dropping to 0 in SCVMM
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ./media/

* *Issue*
+
New or existing SMB 3.0 share size can drop to 0 in System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM).

* *Cause*
+
This issue occurs when quota reinitialization takes a long time in Data ONTAP due to heavy I/O, new or existing SMB 3.0 share size can drop to 0 in SCVMM. Because of this, new VMs cannot be provisioned on the new or existing SMB 3.0 shares.

* *Corrective action*
 .. Turn off the quotas.
 .. Add one default quota rule of type "`tree`" on each volume hosting SMB shares.
 .. Turn on the quotas for those volumes to which you added a default quota rule and restart SMI-S Provider.
