= Network path not found
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ./media/

* *Message*
+
`Network path not found`

* *Description*
+
This message reflects a DNS issue and occurs during VM deployment on an SMB share when the host does not have a record on the DNS server.
+
Typically, the domain DNS server should automatically update the host record within 24 to 48 hours when a new host is configured in the domain. However, this update does not always automatically happen.

* *Corrective action*
 ** If you are a domain administrator, manually update the DNS host record.
 ** If you are not a domain administrator, update the host file (`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`).
+
The host file does not have a file extension (`.txt`).
