summary: "When a client application on a host discovers the CIMOM server by using SLP (CIM-XML encoding over HTTP), the client then queries the CIMOM for shared objects (objects modeled in the CIM language). The CIMOM loads shared objects and queries the storage system by using device-specific APIs for the requested information."

When a client application on a host discovers the CIMOM server by using SLP (CIM-XML encoding over HTTP), the client then queries the CIMOM for shared objects (objects modeled in the CIM language). The CIMOM loads shared objects and queries the storage system by using device-specific APIs for the requested information.

The following illustration shows how NetApp SMI-S Provider interacts with a WBEM management client when SMI-S Provider receives a query or command.
