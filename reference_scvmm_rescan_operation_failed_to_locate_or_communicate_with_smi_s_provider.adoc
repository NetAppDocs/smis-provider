:icons: font
:imagesdir: ./media/

* *Issue*
+
In rare instances, SCVMM is not able to locate SMI-S Provider.

* *Cause*
+
This issue can occur if the security infrastructure is updated with new GPOs. When they take effect after the reboot of SMI-S Provider host, SCVMM host might not trust the SMI-S Provider or the host.

* *Corrective action*
 .. Uninstall SMI-S Provider and install it again.
 .. Run the rescan operation in SCVMM for the SMI-S Provider.
