== Message

`Warning (26130) Storage pool has been allocated to host group where none of hosts in host group has access to storage array.`

== Description

This error occurs when you allocate storage capacity and grant an array access to hosts that are in a host group. With this warning, it is impossible to put virtual machines on the storage systems.

== Corrective action

. On each host machine, add the IP address of each storage system to the iSCSI Initiator application.
. If required, on each storage system, for each host machine, create one unique igroup linked with the proper iSCSI node name from the corresponding host machine.
. For each host machine connected to Data ONTAP, open the MPIO application and add the following hardware ID:
 ** For clustered Data ONTAP, enter `NETAPP LUN C-Mode`.
. Reboot the host machines.
. Remove the provider.
. Set the storage pool again.
